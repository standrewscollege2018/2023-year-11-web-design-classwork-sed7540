<p>This famous old monastery is situated on an island and stands out prominently for miles around.
</p>
<p>Narrow streets and thousands of tourists made for an overwhelming visit.

<p>Our dose of culture on the trip. We spent hours roaming up and down the seemingless endless halls of art.

<p>We kept coming back to the Eiffel Tower, enjoying just hanging out in the park around its base.
</p>
<p>We also enjoyed going to the top of the tower and the incredible view of Paris, not to mention eating delicious ice cream while up there.</p>
